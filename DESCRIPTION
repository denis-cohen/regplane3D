Description: The \code{regplane3D} package is a convenience tool for plotting regression predictions in 3D, based on the \code{\link{plot3D}} package. It plots grid of conditional expectations in three dimensional space, optionally with their respective confidence intervals (\code{regplane3D}, \code{twoplanes3D}). User can optionally add a threedimensional histogram at the bottom of the plot.
